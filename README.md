# 🎓 Student Pass/Fail Classification

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether a student will **Pass or Fail** using supervised machine learning classification techniques.

The prediction is based on academic-related features such as:

- Study Hours
- Attendance
- Previous Score
- Assignment Scores

The problem is treated as a **binary classification task**:

- 1 → Pass
- 0 → Fail

---

## 🧠 Models Implemented

Three supervised learning models were trained and compared:

1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3. Random Forest

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

The models were evaluated using:

- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- F1-Score

These metrics help measure classification performance and balance between precision and recall.

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Logistic Regression is simple and highly interpretable.
- KNN performs well but depends on distance calculations and scaling.
- Random Forest generally provides higher accuracy due to ensemble learning.
- As model complexity increases, interpretability decreases.
